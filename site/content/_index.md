    Joshua has spent the better part of twenty years helping founders get from
    idea to launch and from launch to thriving company. He was the president of
    an e-commerce platform and helped start an eco-friendly plastic company
    whose materials are used today across the yoga and shoe industry.


    In 2012, Joshua was sent on a different kind of journey—a health crisis that
    had him fighting for his life. With the standard of care not working, he
    dove deep into researching genetics, the microbiome, mitochondrial health,
    fasting and ketosis. In 2018 Joshua succeed in hacking his autoimmune
    disease and emerged an athlete, riding over 2000 miles on a single speed
    bike and competing in two triathlons.

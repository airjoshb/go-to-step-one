A "new" Star Wars film was a promise few could actually believe twenty years ago and despite its decidedly small fan base,* Episode I* came with the most impressive hype machine and design craft that the world has ever seen. The teaser posters were stunning, the theatrical poster was gorgeous, the costuming was next level, and the toys launched two weeks before the film dropped are my favorite ever. 

Then there was the film. 

I had scoped out the best theater in the Boston area, because the theaters in the urban core of the 90s were not that great (except the Cheri), waited in line for nine hours for tickets and then waited another three hours opening night. The dislike for the film wasn't globally apparent after it ended, many people cheered and the children in the audience were completely freaking out. The next day, things started to go south. I was far more forgiving than most die-hard Star Wars fans, finding the storyline, visuals, and scope of the film inline with everything I wanted from a modern Star Wars movie. 

Revisiting *The Phantom Menace*, the dialog and odd character voicing never get better, but the visual effects and sound mixing still hold up as one of the biggest achievements in modern cinema. The sound design of the podrace is probably my favorite piece of film audio and remain a favorite of Ben Burtt and Gary Rydstrom who worked on the sound for three years. 

Logan's list of films originally included *Ben Hur* and *The Hidden Fortress*, but I swapped the order of the latter with *American Graffiti* as it is most directly represented in Episode I. I also moved *THX 1138* to the prequel, because while it did seed Lucas' work for *A New Hope*, the themes of oppression and the struggle for autonomy and freedom are more central to the [chronologially] first Star Wars film.

**Ben Hur**

*Ben Hur* is one of the most beloved films of all time, made in an era where going to the cinema was an event that people would sit for over three hours with nothing to distract them. *The Phantom Menace's* most obvious reference to the film is the podrace (which has nearly shot-for-shot similarities at times), but looking a bit deeper, Anakin's story follows the arc of Judah Ben Hur as he navigates the Republic. 

Judah's story has him become a slave as punishment for his loyalty only to later win his freedom by saving a Roman Commander, just as Anakin inadvertently does by bailing out Qui-Gon Jinn. Ben Hur is all over Anakin's story, even matching his thirst for vengeance in Episode II when Anakin returns to his desert home to find his family killed.

Also, like *The Phantom Menace*, after you see *Ben Hur* once, every other viewing is simply wading through to get to the spectacle of the chariot race.

**American Graffiti**

*The Phantom Menace* is a return to themes that Lucas has made throughout his career about freedom, individuality, and the creative spirit inside us all that reaches for something more than our current selves. *American Graffiti* shares more with *Episode I* than a simple fascination with speed and car chases, as the Republic looms over the Outer Rim in *The Phantom Menace*, so did the Vietnam war pervade the atmosphere of the gang hanging around Mel's Diner. 

The tension between freedom and belonging is perhaps the most palpable aspect of *American Graffiti*. Each character is struggling with the next phase of their life and the fleeting moment of choice ends up punctuated as we learn each character's fate at the end of the film. The tension between the comfort of familiar and the longing for more is something the Skywalkers will face throughout the entire Star Wars arc.

**THX 1138**

I think it is safe to say that the idea of an oppressive agent or state is at the core of everything George Lucas has written and filmed. The struggle to be recognized as an individual—a human—is explicitly explored in Lucas's easily-overlooked first film. While Star Wars could be seen as a hopeful dystopia, the world of *THX 1138* is dystopian through and through. Many of the conventions and styles of the Star Wars universe began with this film, including the numbering of drone-like humans and the use of screens and surveillance. Much like *The Phantom Menace*, sound plays an extra character in *THX 1138*, often defining the space and action in stark, colorless reality. If you only think of George Lucas as fantastical and fluffy, you should see what he did with hard science fiction in *THX 1138*.

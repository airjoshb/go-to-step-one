The team at HVMN has been hard at work overhauling their product line since making the switch from "Nootrobox" to a performance-based supplement and food (nutrient?) company at the end of 2018. Coming off a successful launch of their Ketone Ester, HVMN announced new fasting and recovery-focused products. It has taken most of the year to get the new stuff out, but my pre-order of Keto Collagen+ arrived and tl;dr, it was worth the wait.

There are few product categories with as much noise as"keto", having blended mixes for years, I rarely pay for prepared or formulated products. Unlike the folks at HVMN, most of what you get off-the-shelf is made by companies who don't understand the biochemistry of ketosis (or health, for that matter). As soon as I opened the box and looked at the ingredients, I knew that the Keto Collagen+ was a different beast.

**What's good**

Keto Collagen starts with 10g of grass-fed collagen peptides and adds 5g of C8 MCT oil powder, not so different so far, but the devil is the the details. HVMN's mix adds in vitamin C, and chelated forms of copper and zinc, which are vital co-factors for protein synthesisâ€”turning that collagen into something the body can use to build and repair. 

Minerals like copper, magnesium and zinc were the x-factor of the Miraculous Healing Mode protocol I used to heal after complications from surgery left me under the care of my surgeon for six months. With the protocol, I healed completely in 4 weeks, leaving my Stanford doctors stunned by the protein supercharger I had created. 

*You might want to get copper levels checked before adding any additional copper into your diet, but these amounts are relatively small and should work wonders for most people.*

**What's meh**

I am not a fan of stevia, as it can cause gastric distress for folks, like myself, with Crohn's, UC or other gastro-intestinal issues. And it tastes terrible. I prefer a D-ribose or allulose blend with the monk fruit, which will also give you a little performance boost, but the chocolate Keto Collagen+ tastes good. The stevia + monk fruit mix keeps the carbs off the board (net zero), which makes sense optically for the general public who barely understand nutrition labels.

Everyone is hot on C8 MCT oil, and for good reason, as it has been shown to have more cognitive benefits and generate more ketones in the liver than other MCTs. I typically go with a C8/C10 blend as the latter has been shown to have anti-inflammatory benefits by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines. My body creates inflammation better than most people in the world, so I tend to optimize that direction and I would think as a recovery product, having a little more damping of these protein-based cytokines would be a boon.

Since I'm nitpicking, I was a bit disappointed to get a half-empty plastic container when HVMN is producing such great glass packaging for their supplement line. No matter how you spin it, plastic sucks and supplements are one of the few areas I have little control, beyond sourcing ingredients in bulk to cut down on waste (which I primarily do).

**How I really feel**

The bottom line is HVMN's Keto Collagen+ is well thought out and tastes good. I mixed it in with my BHB ketone blend and I even used it to make my favorite training and ride fuel, Tahini Cocoa Bombs, replacing my usual, double-fat Peruvian cocoa powder. That sums up probably the highest recommendation you will ever get from me on a product with the word "keto" in it.

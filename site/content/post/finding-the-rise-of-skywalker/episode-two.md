The group of fans that think *Attack of the Clones* is the best prequel film is short on membership. I may, in fact, be the only one. There is a lot to dislike about the second prequel, not the least of which is how much of the battle that bears the title looks like a video game. Then there is the poorly executed budding relationship between Anakin and Padme. If you loosen up your cringe, *Episode II* opens the aperture of Lucas's vision while returning to the successful formula of splitting the story in two adventures that converge at the climax. We also get much more of Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan on his own as he tries to discover the mysteries of a missing planet, the clone army, and the person behind it. McGregor was the best part of the prequels, consistently delivering both the humor and humanity we project on to the memory of Old Ben.

**The Third Man**

*The Third Man* (1949) is the best noir thriller the genre ever produced. Directed by Carol Reed and based on a novel Graham Greene, *The Third Man* is known for its brilliant dialogue, stunning cinematography, perhaps the best McGuffin in film and a disarmingly peppy score. This probably sounds nothing like *Attack of the Clones*, but stay with me. 

In *The Third Man*, novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) travels to post-war Vienna with the promise of a job from his old friend, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). When Martins arrives, he learns that Lime has been killed and he begins to obsessively dig into a mystery no one appears motivated to solve. Eventually, Martin discovers that his esteemed friend is really a dark opportunist, profiting illegally on selling overpriced medication to ill children. 

To say more would spoil a brilliant third act, but Obi-Wan's search follows a similar thread of confusion, leading to shock and betrayal. Dooku's reveal as a Sith Lord undermining the Jedi Order, and the Republic, echoes Lime's arc. Unfortunately, minimizing the impact of the betrayal is probably the Star Wars film's greatest lost opportunity. Had the early work been done to strengthen the audience's investment in Dooku's stature in the minds of his Jedi brethren and the fact that he was Yoda's Padawan learner, his discovery as a villain would have felt more impactful.


**The Searchers**

John Ford's epic westerns were part of the DNA of Lucas's vision of the space opera—basically combining an old western with the Flash Gordon serials. Of Ford's films, *The Searchers* is often mentioned specifically as a source of inspiration, but it is difficult to recommend for modern viewers. *The Searchers* follows a Confederate soldier, Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), who refused to surrender and returns home just in time to experience an attack and kidnapping by Comanche of his two young nieces. What follows is a journey of revenge, not unlike Anakin's return to Tatooine to find his mother captured by a savage race of nomads. 

What makes *The Searchers* difficult in 2019 is Ethan's rampant bigotry—he doesn't even see his nieces as human anymore, setting off to put them out of their misery (before sparing them in the end). There is a hot debate on the Internet about whether the movie is racist, or simply exposes the racism of the time in Ethan's character, but it is tough to get through.  *The Searchers* is best enjoyed with the sound off, but for a similar cinematic scope without the uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach, I recommend *Lawrence of Arabia* instead.

**Lawrence of Arabia**

You will undoubtedly recognize the impact *Lawrence of Arabia* had on George Lucas in creating *Star Wars* from the moment F.A Young's cinematography of the desert landscape fills the screen. While Tatooine is an obvious foil for the Arabian desert, *Lawrence of Arabia* sticks with Lucas throughout the six films he made. In *Attack of the Clones*, Lucas duplicates a shot filmed in the Plaza de Espana in Seville, Spain (serving as Naboo) as Anakin and Padme discuss politics while walking. The scene matches the shot and motion from *Lawrence of Arabia* where Dryden, General Allenby, and Colonel Brighton walk through the Headquarters of the British Army in Cairo having a similar discussion.

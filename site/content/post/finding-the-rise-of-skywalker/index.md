  I'm taking on the challenge to watch the films that inspired the Star Wars universe before the release of *Episode IX, The Rise of Skywalker*.

Always game for a dive into cinematic threads (also, Star Wars), I couldn't help but offer my two cents when I came across this tweet from Logan, 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a great list, though I would swap *Hidden Fortress* and *American Graffiti*. The characters, Tahei and Matashichi, from Kurosawa&#39;s film were an inspiration for R2 and C-3PO setting off the whole Star Wars universe, while podracing was a return to the street racing Lucas loved</p>&mdash; Joshua Bradley (@airjoshb) <a href="https://twitter.com/airjoshb/status/1118220662273798144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A few days later, with a post-Disneyland flu, I decided to dig into Logan's list, bake in my own thoughts on cinema and Star Wars canon, and watch some films I rarely make time for these days.

I will update this post as I move through the list, but I got you started with the films that inspired *The Phantom Menace* 

-First update: *[Attack of the Clones](#epii)*

-Second update: *[Revenge of the Sith](#epiii)*

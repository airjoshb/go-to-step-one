*Episode III* was the most well received of the prequels, which is interesting, as in some ways it is the least like the other Star Wars films. Audiences came around to Hayden Christensen's decline into the darkness of Darth Vader and the movie is bolstered by the strong performance of Ian McDiarmid's Palpatine and Ewan McGregor's continued embodiment of Obi-Wan. At the time, some critics hailed it as the best Star Wars film since Empire and a few named it the best of all of them. 

As fans, we knew that things were going to go dark and the only light would be the bridge to *A New Hope* with the birth of the Skywalker twins. As in *Attack of the Clones*, Lucas gives us a full view of the galaxy descending into the Empire with an opening battle sequence that is unrivaled in its scale. Dooku gets his comeuppance at the direction of Palpatine and the saber of Anakin. We got a fascinating, and somewhat polarizing character, in General Grievous along with the turning of the Clone Army against the Republic with Order 66. Finally, the battle on Mustafar and Vader's origin story is something fans had waited decades to see realized.


**Battleship Potemkin**

Eisenstein's silent film masterpiece was regarded as the best film of all time before being dethroned by *Citizen Kane*. So many films have pulled inspiration from the movie from *The Untouchables* to *Brazil*, *The Godfather,* and of course *Star Wars*. The film centers on a true mutiny aboard the Potemkin as the sailors got fed up with their treatment and poor living conditions, finally revolting when the Officers moved to execute the dissenters. The men took control of the boat, but not before their leader was killed. They carried his body to Odessa who became increasingly enraged by the treatment of a hard working citizen. The city's rebellion is stamped out by the violent appearance of the Cossack army, but the Potemkin would ultimately prevail, inspiring the rest of the navy to join their cause. 

The massacre in Odessa was fabricated to add dramatic effect to the film (though the violence was not uncommon at the time). Eisenstein's montage style made for one of the most suspenseful sequences in film history and was remixed or even reshot for many films, including the Clone Army march on the Jedi Temple in *Revenge of the Sith*.

**Throne of Blood**

Kurosawa's films loom large over the entire Star Wars universe and is never more apparent than in *Throne of Blood*, Kurosawa’s retelling of Shakespeare’s *Macbeth*. Reimagined as a Japanese Noh play, *Throne of Blood* follows General Washizu, who receives a prophesy telling him he is destined to become Lord of the castle. 

The mythology of the SIth owes much to *Throne of Blood* —Lord Tsuzuki took the throne from his previous master, setting up his own fate at the hands of his closest general. Washizu is faced with the choice of remaining loyal to his lord and risk having the prophecy leaked by Miki, or take the throne by murder, fulfilling the prophecy.  

Washizu and Miki, once best friends and the two most trusted generals, find themselves at odds. The outcomes are different between the films, but you can almost hear Miki plead with Washizu as Obi-Wan does, "You were my brother, Anakin! I loved you." Ultimately, being spurred on by his wife, Washizu chooses what he secretly desires instead of maintaining his loyalty, much like Anakin's decision to betray Mace Windu and the Jedi Order. Like Anakin, Washizu descends into evil before finding a violent end (the end for Anakin Skywalker, that is).

If you ever wondered where Yoda and his home planet came from, look no further than the mystical spirit in a forest of dense fog that provides Washizu with guidance in wrapped nonsensical riddles.

For a bonus, check out Michael Corleone's slide to the dark side. The son of Vito Corleone, Michael's arc isn't as simple as deciding to join his family and become a gangster. Sure, he had murdered a few people, but he didn't make the turn to the dark side until the people closest to him, those that he loved, were taken from him.

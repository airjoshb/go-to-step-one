Here is a recipe for Cassava Waffles from my new cookbook, *[The Crohn's Disease AIP Cookbook](https://amzn.to/3jwOg7j)*.

Because of the high starch content, cassava flour makes a great waffle that crisps up on the outside but remains soft on the inside. These waffles have no grains, eggs, or dairy but will leave you and your whole family completely satisfied. These waffles can be made ahead and kept in the freezer. Toast as needed!

### Ingredients

1 cup whole cassava flour

2 tablespoons tigernut flour, coconut flour, or green banana flour

1 scoop/serving grass-fed/ finished collagen peptides (leave out for vegan waffles)

1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda

1/4 teaspoon sea salt

1 cup coconut milk (no gums or carrageenan)

2 tablespoons avocado oil or melted coconut oil

### Steps
1. Preheat a waffle maker.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the cassava flour, tigernut flour, collagen (if using), baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut milk and oil until well blended, then add to the flour mixture and blend until smooth. The batter should be thick but pourable. If needed, thin it with some water.
3. Pour one-third of the batter onto the center of the waffle maker until three-fourths of the surface
is covered. Close the waffle maker and cook for
3 minutes. Remove the waffle and set aside. Repeat this process with the remaining batter, then serve warm.
### Variations 
Add moringa powder to up the nutrients or top with smoothie ingredients, such as coconut yogurt, fresh berries, or peeled and sliced stone fruit. For a savory approach, add rendered and chopped uncured bacon to the batter or serve with breakfast sausage.

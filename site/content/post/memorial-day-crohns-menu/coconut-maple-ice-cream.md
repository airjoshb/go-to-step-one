Homemade ice cream is not as difficult to make at home as most people think. The job of an ice cream maker is simply to stir or churn the liquid as it freezes to keep the mixture from creating ice crystals. We can accomplish similar results by stirring the mixture every 30-45 minutes until it becomes too difficult to mix.

1 can Coconut Milk, with no gums or additives (for a richer ice cream do 1/2 can of coconut milk and coconut cream each)\
1/2 cups Maple Syrup\
1 scoop Pasture-raised Collagen Peptides
1 cup frozen blueberries\
1/8 teaspoon Sea Salt

1. Heat coconut milk and cream with the syrup in pot just to a simmer. Add gelatin and whisk until fully combined. Add salt, taste for sweetness and adjust as needed. Remove from heat and cool.
2. Add to a freezer-proof container and put into the freezer. After 30-45 minutes, remove and add the blueberries. 
3. Stir with a fork or paddle-like spoon. Return to the freezer and repeat stirring 2-3 times until it becomes too frozen to stir.

Ingredient Tip: You can also replace 1/2 of the coconut milk with coconut yogurt for a tart frozen yogurt dish instead of ice cream.

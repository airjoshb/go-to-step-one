This slaw is packed with prebiotic fiber from celery root and raw Brussels. Prebiotic fiber is crucial for a healthy gut, providing a rich environment for good bacteria to grow. Celeriac is a knobby root that has stalks that resemble celery and when eaten raw has over half of the daily needs for vitamin K and 13% of your daily vitamin C. Brussels Sprouts have a similar nutrient profile and even more vitamin C, as well as being high in minerals. The combo is not only good for gut health, but also reducing inflammation and regulating blood sugar.

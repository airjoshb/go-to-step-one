After a LOT of hard work (mostly getting out of my own way!), I'm so excited to finally announce that I have a new book coming out, "Crohn's Disease AIP Cookbook". 

- **The Crohn’s and AIP connection**—Get an overview of the science behind autoimmune symptoms and how the AIP diet is built to combat them.
- **Amazing food**—I dug deep to create amazingly satisfying and delicious AIP-friendly dishes that are quick to prepare and easy to share with your family.
- **Stay on track**—Handy charts and tips for tracking your symptoms, handling food flare-ups, and quickly referencing what to eat or avoid at different stages of the diet.

I'd love for you to support my book! You can pre-order your copy here: https://amzn.to/3jwOg7j

Stay tuned, I'm pretty excited to share some sneak peeks in the coming weeks!

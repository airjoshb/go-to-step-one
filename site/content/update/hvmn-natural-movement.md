I listened to this episode on how natural movement trumps working out in the gym while running in the Santa Cruz mountains. I found myself taking more opportunities to run/jump through obstacles meant for mountain bikers, work my way around grazing cows, and across creeks. Give it a go! https://pca.st/huagxk2f

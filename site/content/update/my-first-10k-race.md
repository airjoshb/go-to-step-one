With looming storm clouds at the start and sunshine coming into the finish, I couldn't be happier with my first 10K race at the Santa Cruz Half Marathon. I finished on a 9:11 pace ~ 18th in the 40-49 age group and 66th overall for men. I ran fasted, with a half of a bottle of [HVMN Ketones](https://hvmn.com/?r=kzbhpeln) consumed about 1.5 hours before the event. My pre-race ketone levels were 2.0 mmol and my ketone/glucose index was 2.2, which is pretty solid. I'll break my fast at sundown with a glorious dinner to celebrate!

I completed five 5k runs this week for #OstomyDay2022 - few people are more resilient than those  who have had ostomy surgery and live with the challenges every day. Ostomies may be a daily physical, social, and emotional challenge, but they are life saving and don’t have to keep us from accomplishing amazing things.These runs were for all those that can’t 🙏.

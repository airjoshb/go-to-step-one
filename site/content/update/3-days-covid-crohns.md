I am 3 days into testing positive for COVID. My wife had been positive for a few days and while I was not feeling well, I tested negative a couple of times. Then one day, things progressed pretty quickly with a fever, fatige, and feeling terrible. Being on Remicade, my doctors got me on Paxlovid immediately. Initially, the Paxlovid didn't seem to have much of an effect besides coating my entire mouth with the taste of aluminum foil. Today is the first day I haven't been in excruciating pain from head to toe. I am still dealing with fevers at night that break in the morning, but I'm well enough to type this update, so it must be working!

You should take the time to read @eliotpeper's *[True Blue](https://truebluestory.com/)*, released today as a public art project on the web, incorporating web design, illustration, and story. *True Blue* exists in a world where your status and ability is judged by the color of your eyes, reminiscent of *[Gattaca](https://amzn.to/2F1p7OP)*, one of my all-time favorite science fiction films. The story is elevated by beautiful illustrations from Phoebe Morris and Peter Nowell's incredible art direction and development.

Equally as interesting is Eliot's [post](https://medium.com/@eliotpeper/making-true-blue-f66a538d0ea5) about the project and how they went from idea to story, to illustrations, to a web site. There is innovative work underneath a compelling and thoughtful writing, and after reading the behind-the-scenes post, I read *True Blue* on multiple devices to appreciate the micro-animations and "Narrative Responsive Design".

The recounting also reminded me of my own post about how I think of art as a verb, rather than a noun, and how it happens when we create, not as the finished object, which I [resurfaced](/post/art-is-the-making-it/) for you.

Yesterday would have been the start of the 545 mile üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ride from SF to LA to raise money for critical services @AIDSLifeCycle. I met up with a few intrepid cyclists at the Day 1 halfway point and rode them back to #SantaCruz. If you can give in any amount, please do http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/joshuab

October 1st is Ostomy Awareness Day and I am running a virtual 5k to raise money for awareness and research. Please support me or better yet, sign up to run with me! 

Support my run: https://runsignup.com/airjoshb
This is a virtual event, so I created a team you can join here:

If you're in Monterey, come join me on the 5k in person! 

Ostomy surgery is a life-saving, and most often, a permanent procedure that diverts waste through the abdominal wall, creating a stoma that requires the person to wear a pouch. As you can imagine, the physical, social, and emotional stress of this kind of change is a strain that is difficult to talk about. Thank you for your support!

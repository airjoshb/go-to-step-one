I listened to Weezer's [Black Album](https://amzn.to/2EFxzmG) on my recovery ride today and I propose a new sub-genre for the album: Rockxploitation. Rivers and Company are almost a meta-rock band — a real world Spinal Tap — referential, sarcastic, self-deprecating, and a really good time. They also recently released a [Teal album](https://amzn.to/2Xy4vER) wherein they cover what feels like every amazing song, from Aha to Black Sabbath and TLC. Few of the covers will blow you away, but it is pretty much the best Kidz Bop ever! While you are in the Weezer mood, you might as well top it off with this Weezer [SNL skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab5WvwfLuLM) featuring Matt Damon and Leslie Jones in a brawl over the best band of all time.

I listened to Weezer's [Black Album](https://amzn.to/2EFxzmG) on my recovery ride today. Rivers and Co. are almost a meta-rock band, like a real world Spinal Tap â€” referential, sarcastic, self-deprecating and a good time. I propose a new sub-genre for the album: Rockxploitation. If you need more Weezer, they released a [Teal album](https://amzn.to/2Xy4vER) of covers as well and you might as well top it off with this super funny [SNL skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab5WvwfLuLM) with Matt Damon.

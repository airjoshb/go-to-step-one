With Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to a Tribe Called Quest, Hanif Abdurraqib captures the essence, time and even the cadence of the greatest rap group of all time. Weaving his personal journey as a poet with personal letters and a keen sense of the world in which Tribe existed, enfolded and created, Hanif's love letter speaks for us all.

The movie of the week for people who have signed up for the forthcoming Criterion Channel, was Tarkovsky's Stalker. I had never seen this film before, but was immediately struck by how much it reminded me of Annihilation. Watching this film has sent me on a deep dive that I hope to distill and share later, but for now, go watch this film. <https://www.criterionchannel.com/stalker>
